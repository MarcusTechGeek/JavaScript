2. What will be outputted to the console in this instance?
const q = 1;
switch (q) {
case '1':
answer = "one";
case 1:
answer = 1;
case 2:
answer = "this is the one";
break;
default:
answer = "not working";
}
console.log(answer);

2. "this is one" because the break is only included after another test is conducted. so the awnser valuewill be the last value
assigned to awnser after the result was true. thus even if q was '1' the awnser would be the same
